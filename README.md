# Stick-Man
My Stick Man Project. I hope you like it.
I accidently uploaded one version to my dad's account    (Hehehe). I definetly type really really really fast right now without even looking at the keyboard! I drew the picture stuff myself! In all I had to debug it about 15 times! (hehehe again) I keep mixing up my m's and n's.(:o :O :D)
